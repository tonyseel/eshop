> "I think I have Alzheimer's disease," 58-year-old Jayesh Patel* told Mumbai psychiatrist Dr Dayal Mirchandani. Patel had read about Alzheimer's on the Internet and begun to worry. Every time he misplaced his keys or forgot a name, Patel would think he had Alzheimer's disease (AD). Within weeks he went to see Dr Mirchandani. But a neuropsychological test revealed that his memory was normal.

AD is the most common cause of a medical condition known as dementia, which affetcs the brain and hence memory. In addition, the affected person gradually loses the ability to think and behave normally. But where is the boundary between "normal" forgetfulness and dementia? What are the symptoms to wacth out for? And if a person has dementia, then what can he - and his loved ones - do?

### Symptoms

"All of us forget things at times," says Dr K. Jacob Roy, founder and chairman of the Alzheimer's and Related Disorders Society of India (ARDSI). "For example, we may not be able to remember where we left opur keys. But only if we forget the very fact that we have misplaced the keys should we consider that something is seriously wrong with us."

Dementia, which afflicts more than three million Indians, has many causes, and Alzheimer's disease is responsible for about 55-60 percent of all cases. The actual causes of AD are gradually becoming understood: it may be due to certain plaques and tangles seen in the brain of affected persons. Some Canadian researchers believe they are closing in on AD and a cure may be found in the not-too-distant future.

Dementia can also be brought on by broken or blocked blood vessles in the brain, causing the brain to recieve insuffient oxygen resulting in small parts of the brain tissues dying. This is called vascular dementia.

Essentially such changes in tge brain cells cause parts of the brain - particularly the region responsible for storing the memories - to gradually wither away.
