**What happens in your head at night, new science reveals, is more important than you think**

OUR DREAMS MAY AFFECT OUR LIVES (and vice versa) more than we realized, says groundbreaking new research. For 11 years, a 58-year-old anthropologist kept a journal of nearly 5000 dreams. By analyzing colour patters in the dreams, American researcher Robert Hoss could accurately predict certain things about the man's emotional state. 

Hoss correctly identified two separate years when the man experienced crises in his life. The anthropologist confirmed that in 1997 he had clashed with a colleague over a management issue, and in 2003 he'd had a falling out with a friend that left deep emotional scars.

### How was Hoss able to gaughe the dreamer's turmoil? 

"The clues were in the colours,"he says. The anthropologist's dominant dream hues were reds and blacks, which spiked during difficult times. "Even without knowing the events in his life," Hoss observes, "we accurately determined the emotional states based on those colours in his dreams."

Hoss is among a growing group of researchers who, thanks to cutting edge medical technology and innovative psychological research, are beginning to decipher the secrets hidden in our dreams and the role dreaming plays in our lives. A look at some of their latest discoveries can give us new insights into the language of dreams and help us make the most of our time asleep.
