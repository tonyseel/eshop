Diabetes has become a severe threat to health and early detection is vital to combating diabetes. Common signs of diabetic disease are frequent urination, unexplained weight loss, increased hunger, increased thirst and tingling of your hands or feet. Although according to the American Diabetes Associating millions of Americans have little or no signs at all, and therefore are unaware that they even have become diabetic.  With a lack of guaranteed signs, the only true detection is regular diabetes testing.

The preferred method of testing is the Fasting Plasma Glucose Test, which requires 8 hours of fasting. After 8 hours of fasting a healthcare professional will draw a blood sample and send it to the lab, and then wait for results. This method of testing is simple and the most accurate, it's important to note however that the test seems to be more accurate in the morning, however can be done at any time of day.

Normal blood glucose levels will have a range of less than 100 mg/dL, milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood. In the event that the testy results report glucose levels above 126 mg/dL, another test will be ordered on a follow up day to ensure accuracy. Should the second test come back with the same reading, your doctor will confirm that the reading is in the diabetic range and a diagnosis of diabetes will be given. However, should the original test return results within the 100 mg/dL and 125 mg/dL a second test may also be ordered, the glucose is within diabetic range but not quite high enough to warrant a diagnoses.

Pregnant woman are given an oral glucose tolerance test, which was once the standard for testing. The problem with the oral glucose tolerance test is that the accuracy is affected, by general health of the patient, whether or not they are on other medications and activity level. Even though this test isn't the standard any longer, it's still found to be the preferred method of testing with pregnant women.

Should a diabetic diagnoses be received, a Hemoglobin A1c test may be requested. The Hemoglobin A1c measures blood sugar control over a six to twelve week period and is an informative way to monitor blood sugar. This test is used in addition to regular home monitoring test.

Due to the fact that diabetics have been found to have kidney problems, urine test for diabetic kidney disease are often ordered. This particular test is merely measuring the amount of protein within the urine. High protein levels in the urine can result from albumin, protein leakage from the blood into the kidneys and can create severe damage and possible kidney failure.

For the most part all of these diabetes tests are relatively painless and simple. Early detection can make managing and treating a diabetic disease a great deal easier. People live healthy productive lives with diabetes, when they have the knowledge of how to care for their disease. 

Diabetic prevention is also a benefit of regular testing. If test results tend to come back a little higher than the normal range, a dietitian can prepare valuable diabetic prevention eating habits. The more knowledge available, the more equipped health care providers are for planning for their patientâ€™s healthcare. Test sooner and test regularly, to ensure proper ammunition in the fight against diabetes.
