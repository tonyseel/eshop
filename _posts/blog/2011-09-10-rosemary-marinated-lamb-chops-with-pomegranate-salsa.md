Rosemary marinated lamp chops are an excellent dish for an outdoor grill. The marinade is simple, consisting of basics such as olive oil, rosemary, tomato, salt and pepper.  

The secret twist is the pineapple juice. It adds a light citrus sweetness to it. 

Depending on personal preferences, it can be done as medium-rare or well-done. The pomegranate salsa has light and sour freshness to it. The cariander and pomegranate combine well.

### Ingredients

* Lamp chops: 8 pieces
* Pineapple juice: 1/3 cup
* Chopped tomato: 1/3 cup
* Olive oil: 1/2 cup
* Fresh rosemary: 1tsp
* Finely chopped garlic: 1 tsp
* Salt and ground pepper: to taste

### Method

In a large bowl, combine pineapple juice, olive oil, rosemary, tomato, salt and pepper. Mix well. 

Place the lamp chops in the bowl, turn over to coat both sides with marinade; cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Pre-heat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. 

Remove lamb chops from the marinade and shake off excess. Place the lamb chops onto the pre-heated grill and cook till done, about three to four minutes per inch for medium-rare.

Serve with grilled vegetables, pomegranate and coriander salsa.
