I was hesitant at first, but I ended up so relieved and finding peace of mind again. I even got medical advice without having to pay extra. And best of all, I didn’t even leave the house! 

It all started when I became concerned enough to consider getting tested. But I wanted the highest quality service with 100% confidentiality. So, I went online to explore my options and found http://getstdtested.com. The services offered got a 4 out of 5 stars average in customer reviews and I soon found out for myself why that is so.

## Absolute privacy

I decided to explore the site when I found out that insurance information is not required. And I eventually chose to try it out and avail their services because I could pay with an e-check. Payment via debit card and credit card are options as well. This is a good enough deal for the same set of tests that are offered at doctors’ clinics and hospitals.

## Very simple and convenient

It’s quite simple, really. There are four easy steps to follow, and the website is laid out such that even the most uninitiated can easily proceed. The quick links facilitate a very smooth flow. Once the order is finalized, the test or tests can be administered at an accredited center, or at home using a kit that comes complete with instructions. The results arrive within 5 days at the most. I actually got mine in 3 days’ time! I only had to log in and I was able to view my results on the site.

## How it works

I opted for same day testing just to see if it’s really that fast moving as advertised. After finalizing the order on http://getstdtested.com I clicked on the “home” option. I selected the STD tests I wanted done. I still wasn’t comfortable going to a nearby laboratory, but I read very positive reviews about the proceedings. The site offers 4,0000 testing centers that are open beyond 5 pm to cater to the needs of their clients.

I’m pretty good at following instructions and so I felt confident I could do it properly. I won’t go into the details but I was glad I chose to do the tests myself because I learned a lot in the process. I sent the blood and urine sample by mail, and that was the end of it. I was ready to wait for five days and got a pleasant surprise when I was notified that the results were there already. And it was only after 3 days! I’m very happy to receive my result and talk to one of their in-house physicians on the phone who answered my questions very patiently.

## Good advice

The physician I spoke to is a member of a medical advisory board composed of specialists. He explained my results in terms I could understand. I was very much assured by that conversation. The staff physicians even offer treatment and prescribe medication based on the results without the need for a separate appointment.

As a whole it was a very good experience. It was very private and absolutely convenient. Now, I can rest easy.
