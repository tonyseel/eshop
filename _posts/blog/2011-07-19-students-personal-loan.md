As our 2011 calendar flips another page and April rolls around, we once again acknowledge National Financial Literacy Month. This is a time when financial education is promoted, however our education system still lacks overall financial education. Many states do offer some form of financial education as part of another course. Although to date there are only four states, Utah, Missouri, Tennessee and Virginia that have an actual personal finance course requirement.

With lack of personal finance education in our school system, many high school graduates are entering college without the solid financial background to properly analyze their financial decisions. According to Nellie Mae, an affiliate of Sally Mae 50% of all college students has a minimum of 4 credit cards, with an average balance of $4,100. As a result of these numbers, a recent poll was taken where 60% of college credit card holders claimed surprise that their balance had become so high and 40% admitted to charging items they knew couldn't be paid back.

For the 60% of college credit card holders, who found themselves surprised by their credit card balance, personal finance education may have been their saving grace. After all had they fully understood the impact of credit card usage, they would have been able to make a full logical, educated decision. Fortunately, personal finance can be taken in college, however it usually isn't taken until the damage is already done, and credit cards are already maxed out, often with negative credit report consequences. 

Though financial education isn't a current national education requirement there are many outlets to learn financial responsibility, such as some tools found at jump start. Finding the motivation to choose to learn personal finance for the bulk of high school students doesn't always come automatically. If schools aren't teaching personal finance, often it become the responsibility of the parents to guide, their children to learn personal finance and with many households having both parents working outside of the home, more and more children are falling through the cracks.
