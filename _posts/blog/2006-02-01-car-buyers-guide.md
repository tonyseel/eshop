Decades of spending quality time at automobile showrooms has provided me with an ongoing lesson on how the new car buyer in India has evolved.

To start with, there are those of you who WANT to buy a car. And then, there are those of you who NEED a car. Distinct categories, and to be treated as such, this guide is aimed more at those in the NEED sub-set. I mean, if you WANT a car which can range from freedom to status symbols, then NEED is not a factor at all.

The most important factor for the WANT category will therefore be the size of the pocket-book. Check it, and then go for it.

But if you want to consider the NEED option also, then the first thing you do, well before you head for the automobile showrooms, is to sit and analyze your needs.

To do this, you will need to quantify the options into two broad possible scenarios.

* Is there reasonable and safe public transport available to satify the daily needs of your commute and local travel? If so, how much will this cost you on a monthly and then further on an annual basis? A safe rule of thumb is to add another 25% for unforeseen expenses as well as inflation.

* On the other hand, what will the annual cost of owning a new car set you back? Include in this the depreciation in re-sale value, cost of insurance, fuel, regular maintenance, parking, assorted liabilities, inflation on costs, and post warranty maintenance.

So now you've justified to yourself that you WANT as well as NEED a new car...
