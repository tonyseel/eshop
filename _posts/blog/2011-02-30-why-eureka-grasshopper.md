One winter time, I had to go shopping instantly because my 2 boys, who are 7 and 8 years old, had to participate in the Cub Scouts camping.  So, I thought of searching the internet for some practical ideas concerning sleeping bags for kids.  Among the list of sleeping bags that I have come across online, a nice rectangular shaped product called “Eureka Grasshopper - 30 Degree Sleeping Bag” for children caught my attention.

### Discovering a Sleeping Bag with Great Features 

Look what I found out with this amazing product that I’m excited to share with you guys!  It’s a great choice for cabin or car camping, as well as outdoor excursions under temperate weather conditions.  Sleeping bags for kids have a taffeta shell made of polyester with a taffeta inner liner which is also made of polyester along with a single-layer quilt that really provide you with a fresh and warm feeling. 

You’ll surely enjoy a natural sleeping position for your feet with the aid of the foot section.  The product’s other features include a 2-way zipper, an inner stash pocket and a draft tube.  You’ll find this amazing sleeping bag containing Eureka's exclusive proprietary 7-hole polyester Thermashield fiber, which gives you a maximum insulation for a sound sleep. 

In order to provide you with warmth efficiently for the whole night, these sleeping bags contain a Thermashield fiber strand that has 7 tunnel-like holes running the strand’s length.  

### What made me decide to buy Eureka Grasshopper - 30 Degree Sleeping Bags for kids? 

After finding out that this product has gained 5 star reviews overwhelming the 2 stars, I have thought of buying it immediately even without looking at its benefits, because I was running out of time to shop around.  But then, being a more practical buyer instead of an impulsive one, I have decided to browse over some reviews from users mentioning the advantages of buying it compared to other products in the market.

First, I’m pleased to find out that a small pocket with Velcro is available inside the bag to carry a small-size stuffed animal.  It’s also great for storing a pack of tissues that my boys would need for a cold weather like this.  One of the reviews has mentioned that this sleeping bag is so insulating that even below 40 degrees the campers would still feel warm inside it compared to other products of its kind.  Great!  This is precisely the one I need for my boys while they’re camping out there in the woods.

### Take it from my kids

After a quick shipment from Amazon, my boys were so excited to use them for the first time.  They discovered that these sleeping bags are packed well, and they possess a good zipper.  Their length is sufficient that the kids can still use until such time that I have the budget for upgrading them into an adult down bag. 

The boys informed me that the sleeping bags for kids are cute and durable.  In fact, we have already washed them for several times and still, they’re holding up to this time.  They are easy to unzip, and you can be sure that they won’t get stuck up.  Even their color of dark is nice for both boys and girls, so that they won’t become dirty easily just like the light colored ones.  What more, you can fit them in the stuff sack properly than any kind of sleeping bag.  

### Nothing is perfect at all

The only drawback with this sleeping bag is that you’ll find the material inside very cold when you touch it and warms up moderately.  However, the boys still enjoy using a warm blanket inside just like what they used to do at home to feel warm.

Thanks to Amazon, we’re so glad that we had the time to look for sleeping bags for kids online, instead of settling for those available lightweight products in the market.  So, what are you waiting for?
